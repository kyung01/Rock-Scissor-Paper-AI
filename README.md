# Introduction
Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors AI project! This project is a simple implementation of a machine learning model that plays the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The model is trained on a dataset of boolean representations of rock, paper, and scissors. The goal of this project is to showcase the basic principles of classification using machine learning in an unconventional way.

## Features
* Trained on a dataset of boolean representations of rock, paper, and scissors
* Classifies input into rock, paper, or scissors
* Built using C# and Visual Studio
* Uses a unique approach to machine learning, using boolean values for bias and weight
## Requirements
* Visual Studio
* C#

Open the solution file in Visual Studio
Build and run the project
Note: You can also use your own dataset to train the model by replacing the existing dataset with your own.
